# Information about epass software

## Under development. ⚠️

The epass software is a console-based password management application that stores and encrypts information locally. To use the program, simply create a master password and then you can create or view new passwords.

This software uses the AES256 algorithm to encrypt the stored information. Please note: If you forget your master password, there is no way to recover the saved passwords in the program.
